# WHAT IS  Recursion - "Mise en abyme" OR the "Droste effect" - a picture within a picture
# The process of repeating items in a self-similar way
'''
French "put in the abyss", [miːz ɒn əˈbɪːm]) is a transgeneric and transmedial technique that can 
occur in any literary genre, in comics, film, painting or other media. It is a form of similarity and/or repetition, and hence a variant of self-reference

# SOLUTION:
# How many twists does it take to screw in a light bulb? 
# Is it already screwed in? Then zero. If not, then twist it once, ask me again, and add 1 to my answer....


# WHAT is RECURSION? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Algorithmycally: ~~~~~~~~ a way to design solutions to problems by 'dividing-and-conquer' or 'decrease-and-conquer'
# - in other words, to reduce a problem to a simpler version of the same problem

# Semantically: ~~~~~~~~ a programming technique where 'a function calls itself'
# - in programming, the goal is NOT to have an infinite recursion
# - must have 1 or more base cases that are easy to solve
#- must solve the same problem on some other input with the goal of simplifying the larger problem input
